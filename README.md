# Phishing-Webiste-Detection-Using-ML
The phishing website detection based on machine learning is a hotspot of current 
phishing website detection research. The results of machine learning methods usually 
depend on the quality of the extracted features. The focus of current research is on how to 
extract and select more effective features before processing them.
The main objective of this project is to reduce phishing and use website URLâ€™s 
effectively. Phishing website recognition framework gives solid security system to 
distinguish and forestall phishing areas from arriving at client.
